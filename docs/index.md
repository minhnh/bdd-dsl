# Model-Based BDD for Robotics

This is the landing page for the associated tooling to support the specification and
execution of acceptance tests for robotic applications using the
Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)[^north2003bdd] methodology.
BDD complements the ExSce by introducing the scenario view on the robotic system using
a `Given-When-Then` cascade. The "Given" clause captures the pre-conditions including
the robotic system and its state, the "When" clause describes an event that the system
should react to, while the "Then" clause specifies the desired or expected behaviour.
However, applying traditional BDD approaches to MRS applications can be challenging
due to the complex interplay of multiple variability dimensions and domains involved in
describing robotic scenarios. To address these challenges more effectively, `bdd-dsl`
introduces a metamodel for defining composable BDD scenario templates that can be
customized to specific robotic use cases. The metamodel design takes inspiration from
a similar approach used for managing data structures [^alferez2019] and is further supported
by an analysis of competition rulebooks to identify the variability dimensions that may arise
when evaluating robotic scenarios [^nguyen2023rulebook].

This library is one of the tools developed for the
[Executable Scenario Workbench](https://sesame-project.github.io/exsce/)

BDD models can be found on the following pages:
