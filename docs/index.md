# Model-Based BDD for Robotics

This is the landing page for the associated tooling to support the specification and
execution of acceptance tests for robotic applications using the
Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)[^north2003bdd] methodology.
BDD complements the ExSce by introducing the scenario view on the robotic system using
a `Given-When-Then` cascade. The "Given" clause captures the pre-conditions including
the robotic system and its state, the "When" clause describes an event that the system
should react to, while the "Then" clause specifies the desired or expected behaviour.
However, applying traditional BDD approaches to MRS applications can be challenging
due to the complex interplay of multiple variability dimensions and domains involved in
describing robotic scenarios.

To address these challenges more effectively, `bdd-dsl` introduces a metamodel for defining
composable BDD scenario templates that can be customized to specific robotic use cases.
The metamodel design takes inspiration from a similar approach used for managing
data structures [^alferez2019] and is further supported by an analysis of competition rulebooks
to identify the variability dimensions that may arise when evaluating
robotic scenarios [^nguyen2023rulebook]. A more user-friendly DSL that can generate valid
RDF graphs for working with `bdd-dsl` can be found on the
[RobBDD](https://github.com/minhnh/robbdd) repository.

This library is one of the tools developed for the
[Executable Scenario Workbench](https://sesame-project.github.io/exsce/)

## Quick start

### Installation

1. Install [rdf-utils](https://github.com/secorolab/rdf-utils/)
1. Install `bdd-dsl` with `pip install`

### Gherkin generation & mockup execution with `behave`

A mockup test execution setup with [`behave`](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is available
for trying out our models. To run this setup:

1. Generate the Gherkin feature using the [`generate_bdd_specs.py`](https://github.com/minhnh/bdd-dsl/blob/-/examples/generate_bdd_specs.py)
   script. This should create a `*.feature` file under the `examples/generated` directory.
1. Execute `behave` under `examples/generated` should run the mockup setup.

An execution setup with [Nvidia Isaac Sim](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/index.html)
is available at the [`minhnh/bdd-isaacsim-exec`](https://github.com/minhnh/bdd-isaacsim-exec) repository.

## Tutorials

BDD models can be found on the following pages:
