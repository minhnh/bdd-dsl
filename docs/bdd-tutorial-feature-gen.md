# Tutorial: Generating Gherkin features for a simple pickup task

This tutorial will first showcase how [concepts from our metamodels](bdd-concepts.md) can be used
to model acceptance criteria of a simple pickup task as Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)
scenarios, as well as how variations of such scenarios can be introduced in the model. An example
is then presented to show how to transform this model into a
[Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) feature for integration with appropriate
BDD toolchains, e.g. [`behave`](https://behave.readthedocs.io) for the Python language.

## Specifying BDD Acceptance Criteria for a Pickup Task

This section assumes familiarity with BDD concepts. For a review please take a look at the
[documentation for the BDD metamodel](bdd-concepts.md#bdd-review).

### Modelling BDD scenarios

Variations of both the scenario definition and acceptance criteria can then be introduced to this
template for tailoring to different variants of the pickup task, e.g. for different robotic
competitions.

### Scenario variables

## Specifying concrete scenario variant

### Variation of objects, workspaces, agents

### Variation of criteria
